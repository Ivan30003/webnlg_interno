# WebNLG 2023 Challenge

The new edition of WebNLG focuses on four under-resourced languages which are severely under-represented in research on text generation, namely Maltese, Irish, Breton and Welsh. In addition, WebNLG 2023 will once again include Russian, which was first featured in WebNLG 2020.

For WebNLG 2023, we are soliciting submissions encompassing a variety of approaches to automatic text generation, from neural architectures to rule-based systems. We especially encourage submissions addressing generation in few-shot or zero-shot settings.

## Data
Development and test data is now available for all 5 languages, namely Breton, Maltese, Irish and Welsh (the target languages for WebNLG 2023), as well as Russian. Participants can download the development data; the test data will be reserved for the final evaluation.

Data for each language was obtained by sourcing high-quality, professional translations of the original English texts in the WebNLG 2020 dev and test sets. 

Training data is also available for the original WebNLG English data and, as per WebNLG 2020, for Russian. In addition, we provide ‚Äònoisy‚Äô training data for the target languages (Maltese, Breton, Welsh and Irish), obtained via machine translation of the texts in the English WebNLG 2020 train split.

## Evaluation
As in previous editions of WebNLG, submitted results will be evaluated using both automatic and human evaluation methods.
